(Important note: First write the face_train.py file and run it. The file will create another file and that's important)
This is a face recognition using python.
Libraries requireq: opencv-python, numpy, pickle, pillow and os
You also need to download haarcascade file, just go to that file click on raw, it will redirect you to a page, right click(anywhere) and click save.
You only need to write code for facedetection.py and face_train.py, the other two file will be downloaded when you run the face_train file.
Also create a folder for your images, like i have given.
I hope you like it.
